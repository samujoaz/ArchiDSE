This directory contains source code for a version of libc specifically
intended for use on the TI MSP430 microcontroller family, in conjunction
with mspgcc.

This material was collected over several years from a variety of sources.
Licensing information can be found in the file COPYING.

The development project for msp430-libc is
https://sourceforge.net/projects/mspgcc; the development repository is:

	git://mspgcc.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/mspgcc/msp430-libc

You should ensure you have msp430 versions of binutils and gcc installed.
You should also obtain the current msp430mcu release from the mspgcc
project; this provides headers for each of the microcontrollers in the
MSP430 product line.

Until we get around to converting this to autoconf, build with:

  cd src
  make
  make PREFIX=/path/to/mspgcc/installation install

The PREFIX path should be the same as the --prefix you provided when
building binutils and gcc.
